Product Requirement Document (PRD)
Product Name: Symbiotek
 Version: Draft v1.0
 Date: August 11, 2025
 Prepared By: Izzy, Seth, Nick

1. Product Overview
Description:
 Plant Companion transforms plant care into a two-way, emotionally engaging relationship. Using a connected planter with embedded sensors for light and moisture, and an AI-powered mobile app, the product interprets a plant’s needs into an anthropomorphic personality. This “voice” communicates with users in real-time—via app notifications, ambient lighting cues on the pot, and historical care insights—creating a deep bond between human and plant while improving plant health outcomes.

"Redefining Plant Care as a Wellness Experience Through Intelligent Connection with Nature"
Primary Goals:
Enable plants to “communicate” their needs in a conscious, emotionally resonant way.


Provide actionable, data-driven care guidance in real-time.


Foster user mindfulness, empathy, companionship, and joy in caring for living things.


Secondary Goals:
Enhance plant health and longevity.


Build a scalable AI + IoT platform for future connected wellness products.


Position the product in the premium wellness tech market.



3. Target Audience
Primary Segments:
Millennials & Gen Z urban dwellers with an interest in wellness, houseplants, and smart home tech.


Plant parents seeking deeper engagement and improved plant care.


Secondary Segments:
New plant owners who need guidance.


Mindfulness enthusiasts who value nature-based well-being.

Ambient Feedback:


LED strip or small indicator light to convey mood/status (colors and animations tied to plant “emotions”).


Connectivity:


Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for setup and real-time syncing.


Optional Wi-Fi module for remote monitoring.


Battery & Power:


Rechargeable lithium-ion battery with USB-C charging (target 30-day battery life under normal use).

4.2 Software Features (Mobile App)
Core Functions:
Real-Time Status Dashboard


Displays moisture %, light exposure, and plant “mood.”


Shows whether the plant needs water, more light, or protection from excess light.


AI-Driven Plant Personality


Natural language output based on sensor readings (“I’m feeling thirsty today 🌱💧”).


Adjustable personality styles (calm, playful, scientific).


Push Notifications & Reminders


Alerts for watering needs, light adjustments, and care milestones.


Customizable notification frequency (daily, weekly, critical only).


Ambient Feedback Control


Adjust LED color, brightness, or turn off from the app.


Different light patterns for different needs (slow blue pulse = thirsty, bright yellow = too much sun).


History & Insights


Trend graphs for moisture and light over time.


Care log with tips based on seasonal changes.


User Customization


Name your plant.
Choose a plant type: tropical houseplant, cactus, vine


Select or customize personality traits and “voice” tone.



4.3 AI Layer
Data Interpretation:


Converts moisture/light sensor values into care recommendations using thresholds.


Adjusts thresholds over time based on user care history and plant type.


Personality Engine:


Generates conversational, anthropomorphic responses.


Integrates with OpenAI/GPT for dynamic interactions.


Learning Component:


Tracks user responsiveness and adjusts reminder frequency.


Adapts plant personality based on interactions.

6. User Stories
As a plant owner, I want to see my plant’s moisture and light status so I know when to water or adjust light.


As a busy user, I want the app to send me alerts only when necessary so I’m not overwhelmed with notifications.


As a plant enthusiast, I want my plant to “talk” to me in a fun, friendly way so I feel more connected.


As a new plant owner, I want clear, science-backed care advice so I can keep my plant healthy.


As a designer-conscious user, I want the pot to be aesthetically pleasing so it fits into my home decor.



7. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: App must update readings within 2 seconds of receiving BLE data.


Security: All data transmitted between pot and app must be encrypted (AES-128 or higher).


Reliability: Pot must operate in a range of 0°C–40°C.


Scalability: System must support multiple pots per user account.


Battery Life: Minimum 30 days between charges.



8. Success Metrics
User Engagement: DAU/WAU > 40%


Plant Survival Rate: >20% improvement over baseline for users after 6 months.


Retention: 6-month retention > 35%.


Customer Satisfaction: Average rating ≥ 4.5/5 in app store.



9. Competitive Advantage
Combines scientific accuracy with emotional engagement through anthropomorphic AI.


Full-stack integration of hardware and software for a seamless experience.


Wellness-first positioning differentiates from purely functional plant sensors.



10. Risks & Mitigations
Risk
Impact
Mitigation
Sensor drift over time
Plant care recommendations become inaccurate
Calibration algorithm + user prompts
BLE connectivity issues
Users can’t get real-time updates
Add local storage on pot + auto-sync
Users find personality gimmicky
Reduced engagement
Allow personality customization & on/off toggle
Hardware cost too high
Market adoption slower
Tiered pricing, offer pot and sensor module separately


11. Roadmap
Phase 1 (MVP – 6 months)
Moisture + light sensing pot with BLE connectivity.


Mobile app with dashboard, notifications, and basic personality.


Phase 2 (Enhancement – 6-12 months)
Multiple personality modes, historical trends, customizable LED patterns.


AI learning to adapt notifications.


Phase 3 (Expansion – 12-18 months)
Wi-Fi remote monitoring.


Integration with smart home assistants (Alexa, Google Home).


Multi-plant management features.



12. Appendices
Sensor Specification Sheet (to be determined by hardware vendor).


App UI Wireframes (to be developed by design team).


Sample AI Dialogue Scripts (early prototype examples).



I can follow this by creating visual wireframes for the app flow and sample AI dialogue interactions so your PRD also doubles as a pitch deck element for investors.
 That way, you’ll have both the specs and the emotional hook in one package.
Do you want me to make the wireframes + sample AI plant dialogues next? That would bring the PRD to life visually and emotionally.
